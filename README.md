## Heterogeneous Agent-based Model for Supermarket Competition

This project analyses the effects of competitive pricing behaviours between grocery retailers on the the British market. This will be achieved by creating a multi-agent model containing retailer and consumer agents. Within the model, it will be observed how supermarkets
with differing behaviours aspect a heterogeneous crowd of consumer agents. The heterogeneous crowd of retailers will exhibit either carnivorous or herbivorous behaviour over the environment. Following on from consideration of different economic models, an explicit mathematical model has been designed. It is based on the Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework using an abstraction of the real world, so that software agents have a discrete environment to operate within. Up to now the model has design stage and is about to be implemented in Java. It will be used to see the sustainability of volatile pricing strategies (Dec, 2015)
